MSPT Order Service Application Service Layer

This layer conceals/hides the internal business/domain operations from the higher layers.

It provides interfaces and adapters to the infrastructure layers for accessing the business/domain layers.
The infrastructure layers do not need to know the internal behavior of the business layer,
just as the business layer does not need to know and understand the specific infrastructure implementations as well.
